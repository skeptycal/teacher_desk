[3,1,3]

even if a theory is false ... it may work ...

... there are some solutions to problems that work completely, but are not
the actual solution to the problem ...

... and if it works, we can assume it is true and get work out of it ...

_Any theory that generates a testable solution will work fine._

_We do not care if it true or not._
